# Obsidian Vault Organizer Agent - Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation & File System Integration

### 1.1 Environment Setup
- Install and configure Ollama with Qwen3:1.7b model
- Set up LangGraph development environment
- Create project structure with proper dependency management
- Set up testing framework (pytest recommended)

### 1.2 Obsidian Vault Access
- **File System Operations**
  - Implement vault discovery (locate .obsidian folder)
  - Create file reader for markdown files (.md)
  - Handle Obsidian-specific syntax (wikilinks, tags, frontmatter)
  - Parse metadata and YAML frontmatter
- **Security Considerations**
  - Implement safe file path handling
  - Add validation for vault structure
  - Create backup mechanisms before modifications

### 1.3 Markdown Processing
- Parse Obsidian markdown syntax:
  - Wikilinks: `[[Note Name]]` and `[[Note Name|Display Text]]`
  - Tags: `#tag` and `#nested/tag`
  - Block references: `[[Note^block-id]]`
  - Embeds: `![[Note]]` and `![[image.png]]`
- Extract and maintain link graph relationships
- Handle frontmatter (YAML metadata)

## Phase 2: Core Agent Functionality

### 2.1 LangGraph Agent Architecture
- **State Management**
  - Define agent state schema (current vault, active notes, user intent)
  - Implement state persistence across conversations
  - Create context management for long conversations

- **Tool Implementation**
  - `read_note(note_name)` - Retrieve and parse note content
  - `update_note(note_name, content)` - Modify existing notes
  - `create_note(note_name, content, tags, location)` - Create new notes
  - `search_notes(query)` - Search by content, tags, or metadata
  - `list_notes(filter_criteria)` - Browse vault contents
  - `get_backlinks(note_name)` - Find notes linking to target note

### 2.2 Natural Language Processing
- Intent classification for user requests:
  - Read/retrieve information
  - Update/modify content
  - Create new content
  - Organize/restructure
  - Search/find
- Entity extraction (note names, tags, dates, etc.)
- Content summarization and analysis

### 2.3 Graph Operations
- Build and maintain note relationship graph
- Implement graph traversal algorithms
- Detect orphaned notes and broken links
- Suggest connections between related notes

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

### 3.1 Smart Content Operations
- **Template System**
  - Create note templates for different types (meeting notes, daily notes, etc.)
  - Template variable substitution
  - Auto-populate based on context

- **Content Enhancement**
  - Auto-tagging based on content analysis
  - Suggest related notes while writing
  - Extract and organize key information
  - Generate summaries for long notes

### 3.2 Vault Organization
- **Structure Analysis**
  - Analyze folder structure and suggest improvements
  - Detect naming inconsistencies
  - Identify duplicate or similar content

- **Maintenance Operations**
  - Fix broken wikilinks
  - Update outdated information
  - Merge similar notes
  - Archive old/unused notes

## Phase 4: RAG Implementation

### 4.1 Vector Database Setup
- Choose embedding model (sentence-transformers recommended)
- Set up vector database (Chroma, FAISS, or Qdrant)
- Design chunking strategy for markdown content
- Handle metadata embedding (tags, creation date, etc.)

### 4.2 Indexing Pipeline
- **Content Preparation**
  - Clean markdown syntax for better embedding
  - Handle code blocks and special formatting
  - Extract and index images/attachments metadata
  - Create hierarchical chunks (section, paragraph, sentence level)

- **Real-time Updates**
  - File system monitoring for vault changes
  - Incremental indexing for modified notes
  - Efficient re-indexing strategies

### 4.3 Retrieval System
- **Hybrid Search**
  - Combine semantic search (embeddings) with keyword search
  - Use graph relationships for context expansion
  - Implement re-ranking algorithms

- **Context Management**
  - Retrieve relevant note sections
  - Include linked notes for context
  - Handle long document contexts efficiently

## Phase 5: User Interface & Integration

### 5.1 Interface Options
- **Command Line Interface**
  - Interactive chat mode
  - Batch processing commands
  - Configuration management

- **API Server**
  - RESTful API for external integrations
  - WebSocket support for real-time updates
  - Authentication and rate limiting

- **Optional Web Interface**
  - Simple web UI for vault visualization
  - Note editing capabilities
  - Graph visualization of relationships

### 5.2 Obsidian Plugin (Future Enhancement)
- Native Obsidian plugin for seamless integration
- Custom commands and hotkeys
- Sidebar panel for agent interaction

## Phase 6: Testing & Optimization

### 6.1 Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core functions
- Integration tests with sample vaults
- Performance testing with large vaults
- User acceptance testing

### 6.2 Performance Optimization
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed notes
- Parallel processing for batch operations
- Memory management for large vaults
- Response time optimization

## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Libraries & Dependencies
```python
# Core dependencies
langchain-community  # For LangGraph
ollama              # Ollama integration
sentence-transformers  # For embeddings
chromadb           # Vector database
pydantic           # Data validation
watchdog           # File system monitoring
frontmatter        # YAML frontmatter parsing
markdown           # Markdown processing
```

### Configuration Management
- YAML/JSON config files for:
  - Vault paths and settings
  - Model configurations
  - RAG parameters
  - Agent behavior settings

### Error Handling & Logging
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Graceful error handling for file operations
- User-friendly error messages
